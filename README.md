# Zongheng_novel_spider
---
After visiting a site redirected from `m.baidu.com`, some novels on [zhongheng](www.zongheng.com) is free to read without any order info.

But that link is varying according to time, so I use a spider to get that free link and save the cookie info, with the cookie, the spider will get the novel easily.

+ <b>Use all spiders in a civilized way, so please not use it for commercial interests</b>
+ <b>Use all spiders in a civilized way</b>
+ <b>Use all spiders in a civilized way</b>

+ Only support novels that are free to get when you search it on `m.baidu.com` and it will redirect you to `m.zongheng.com`.
+ In order not to be blocked, may neet to adjust the `sleep time`, that is to say, if you want to get a novel more than 1000 chapters, it will take a long time.
